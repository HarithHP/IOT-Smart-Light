# IOT-Smart-Light

The result of the Smart Light, we can control all functions via mobile app.
When we turn on the Smart Light system, the bulb turns on Automatically. Then system identify
whether light is day or night by using LDR sensor. If it is daytime, the bulb will be turn off after
one minute. If it is nighttime, the bulb will be turn off after five minutes. But, that nighttime
process little bit different than daytime process. Because only if there is any motion around the
system, this bulb doesnâ€™t turn off within five minutes. That motions are identified by PIR sensor.
And also, we have included Gas detector sensor to this system for identify air quality around the
system. If the air quality is normal, green color LED has turned on continuously. In addition to
that, if there is a gas leakage or any abnormal situation of air than 50% when compare with the
normal air condition, Red LED will be turned on and make a beep pattern continuously also
Green LED will be turned off as soon as the Red LED turn on. That beep pattern is, making the
sound for a half second and there is no sound for half second. If there is gas leakage or abnormal
situation more than 70% of air, system will be made continuous beep sound.
By Gas detector sensor, we can get real time information about the air quality via Blynk IOT
platform. And also, we have developed that IOT platform to turn off or turn on whole system,
turn on and turn off main bulb, enable and disable air quality monitoring system as manner.
When air quality monitoring system is disabled, Green LED will be blink then that air quality
monitoring system  will be disabled.
